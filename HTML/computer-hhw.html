				The Role of ICT in Energy Efficiency

				<h2>What is ICT?</h2>
				Information and communications technology (ICT) is an
				extensional term for information technology (IT) that
				stresses the role of unified communications and the
				integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and
				wireless signals) and computers as per IFGICT, as well as
				necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and
				audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit,
				understand and manipulate information as per the
				international federation of ICT.
				<br /><br />
				The term ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of
				audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks
				through a single cabling or link system. There are large
				economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the
				computer network system using a single unified system of
				cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an
				umbrella term that includes any communication device,
				encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and
				network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as
				the various services and appliances with them such as video
				conferencing and distance learning.
				<br /><br />
				ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving. It
				covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate,
				transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital
				form (e.g., personal computers including smartphones,
				digital television, email, or robots). Theoretical
				differences between interpersonal-communication technologies
				and mass-communication technologies have been identified by
				the philosopher Piyush Mathur. Skills Framework for the
				Information Age is one of many models for describing and
				managing competencies for ICT professionals for the 21st
				century.

				<h2>Green ICT!</h2>
				Green computing, green ICT as per International Federation
				of Global & Green ICT "IFGICT", green IT, or ICT
				sustainability, is the study and practice of environmentally
				sustainable computing or IT.
				<br /><br />
				The goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry:
				reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy
				efficiency during the product's lifetime, the recyclability
				or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste.
				Green computing is important for all classes of systems,
				ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers.
				Many corporate IT departments have green computing
				initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT
				operations.
				<br><br>
				Modern IT systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green
				computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user
				satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are
				also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of
				the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common
				sense."

				<h2>ICT and Energy</h2>
				Information and communication technology (ICT) is one of the
				pillars of today’s society – it not only has a major impact on our
				professional and private life, it has also become one of the most
				important drivers of economic growth. In the past, however,
				economic development with its steady increase in productivity,
				consumption, and mobility usually went hand in hand with
				increasing usage of natural resources. Even though for most
				countries energy consumption grew slower than the gross domestic product, the world-wide yearly energy
				consumption steadily.
				<br /><br />
				High hopes rest upon ICT to reduce resource and
				energy consumption in other economic sectors, and thus to mitigate global warming. This could mean, for
				example, to improve
				with the help of ICT the energy efficiency in established processes
				(i.e., increase the ratio of a relevant target variable such as productivity or comfort to energy
				consumption), or to enable by ICT new
				concepts to generate, allocate, distribute, share, and use energy in
				a resource-efficient and environmentally-friendly way.

				<h2>Energy Efficiency with ICT</h2>
				Information and communication technology (ICT) consumes
				energy, but it is also an important means to conserve energy.
				Classically, it did so by optimizing the performance of energyusing systems and processes in industry
				and commerce. In the
				near future, ICT will also play a critical role in supporting the
				necessary paradigm shifts within the energy sector towards a more
				sustainable generation of electricity. However, with the advent of
				“smart” technology from the ubiquitous computing domain, further possibilities to reduce the growing
				energy consumption in the
				residential sector are now emerging. In that respect we discuss
				how taking the consumer “in the loop” can realize energy savings
				on top of efficiency gains through automated systems, and we
				describe a prototype application that aims at inducing a desired
				behavioral change by providing direct feedback on household
				electricity consumption.
				<br /><br />
				There is much talk and many studies of how ICT can make a big impact
				on energy efficiency, but it only truly comes alive when looking at actual
				examples.
