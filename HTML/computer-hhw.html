					<h2>What is ICT?</h2>
					Information and communications technology (ICT) is an
					extensional term for information technology (IT) that
					stresses the role of unified communications and the
					integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and
					wireless signals) and computers as per IFGICT, as well as
					necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and
					audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit,
					understand and manipulate information as per the
					international federation of ICT.
					<br /><br />
					The term ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of
					audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks
					through a single cabling or link system. There are large
					economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the
					computer network system using a single unified system of
					cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an
					umbrella term that includes any communication device,
					encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and
					network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as
					the various services and appliances with them such as video
					conferencing and distance learning.
					<br /><br />
					ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving. It
					covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate,
					transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital
					form (e.g., personal computers including smartphones,
					digital television, email, or robots). Theoretical
					differences between interpersonal-communication technologies
					and mass-communication technologies have been identified by
					the philosopher Piyush Mathur. Skills Framework for the
					Information Age is one of many models for describing and
					managing competencies for ICT professionals for the 21st
					century.

					<h2>Green ICT!</h2>
					Green computing, green ICT as per International Federation
					of Global & Green ICT "IFGICT", green IT, or ICT
					sustainability, is the study and practice of environmentally
					sustainable computing or IT.
					<br /><br />
					The goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry:
					reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy
					efficiency during the product's lifetime, the recyclability
					or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste.
					Green computing is important for all classes of systems,
					ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers.
					Many corporate IT departments have green computing
					initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT
					operations.

					<h2>Brazil</h2>
					The most important measure in the energy balance of Brazil
					is the total consumption of 578 thousand GWh of electric
					energy per year. Renewable energies include wind, solar,
					biomass and geothermal energy sources. This means all energy
					sources that renew themselves within a short time or are
					permanently available. Brazil produces around 465 thousand
					GWh of renewable energy per year, which is around 80% of
					their total energy consumption.
