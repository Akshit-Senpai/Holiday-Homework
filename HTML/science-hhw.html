				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				According to me, China is doing the best among all the
				countries in the world on renewal energy front. China
				produces the highest amount of renewable energy in the whole
				world. The other countries which are doing great in this
				field are United States of America, Brazil, Canada, India
				etc. The most efficient source of renewable energy is Hydro
				Power, although it takes a lot of investment and time to
				construct the plant but in the long run, it is very
				rewarding.

				<h2>
					Space based Solar Energy
				</h2>
				This technology was first
				proposed by an aerospace engineer by the name of Peter Glaser in 1968. People also consider him to be
				the “the father of the solar-powered satellite.”
				However, they have never fully realized it. This model of harnessing energy is based upon the fact that
				sunlight in space is largely uninterrupted. Current solar technology is at the mercy of weather
				conditions. It can only produce energy during daylight hours.
				Space-based solar farms overcome these obstacles by eliminating nighttime blackouts and inclement
				weather. Additionally, sunlight found outside Earth’s atmosphere is 30% more intense than the sunlight
				we receive on Earth’s surface.
				<br><br>
				The biggest challenge is getting the harnessed energy back down to Earth. The energy these solar farms
				produce can be sent down in the form of microwaves or with a powerful laser. The issue with this is that
				the cost of the entire process currently outweighs the benefit of the increased power production it
				provides.
				<br><br>
				With the rise of private space companies, some have predicted that this technology could be commercially
				viable within 30 years. China currently has plans to construct a space-based solar farm. They claim to
				already be testing the technology and aim to have a functioning space-based solar farm before 2050.
				<br><br>
				<dl>
					<h3>Advantages of Space Bases Solar Energy Farms</h3>
					<dt>Can deliver energy anywhere on Earth </dt>
					<dt>Circumvents current drawbacks of traditional solar energy production </dt>
				</dl>
				<br>
				May be commercially viable within the next 30 years.

				<h2>
					Human Energy
				</h2>
				Humans gather calories through the consumption of food, which our bodies then convert into usable
				energy. We use this energy for vital functions, such as keeping our hearts beating or powering our
				brains. However, much of the energy our bodies produce is also used in the forms of heat and kinetic
				energy
				through movement. Much of this is goes to waste and remains unclaimed by humans.
				<br><br>
				At rest, the average person’s body produces around 100 watts of power. Production is much higher when
				performing vigorous activities. For example, cycling can generate 400 watts of power per hour. However,
				top-performing cyclists have been recorded generating up to 1800 watts. That was during short bursts of
				exertion.
				<br><br>
				There are two big issues with the harnessing of human energy.
				The first is that current energy harvesting strategies are not very efficient. However, this is set to
				change in the future. Scientists are developing technologies that harness this energy at enhanced
				efficiencies and at a lower cost.
				<br><br>
				The second problem holding back human power as a viable renewable energy source is that of modern
				battery technology. The battery systems currently available to us are too large, heavy and bulky to make
				this sort of technology viable. However, recent breakthroughs in energy-storing technology may soon be
				on the horizon.
