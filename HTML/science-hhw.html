						<h3>
							Advantages of using Solar Energy:-
						</h3>
						<dt>
							Lower Electricity Bills.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							You only pay for the deficit power consumed i.e. the difference between power consumed by the household from the grid and the solar power generated from the panels. This drastically reduces your electricity bill.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Diverse Applications.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Solar energy can be used for diverse purposes like generating electricity or heat. Some more uses for solar energy are solar ventilation, solar transportation, solar charging etc.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Technology Development.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Technology is constantly advancing and improvements will intensify in the future. Innovations in quantum physics and nanotechnology can potentially increase the effectiveness of solar panels and double, or even triple, the electrical output of the solar power systems!
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Low Maintenance.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Net metering system components like solar panels, inverter and mounting structures need low to no maintenance. Since these installations do not require generators or batteries, expense for their maintenance is avoided. This saves not just money but time too!
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<br>

						<h3>
							Common Uses/Applications of Solar Energy:-
						</h3>
						<dt>
							Solar Electricity.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							This is one of the solar energy applications that has gained a lot of momentum in recent years. As solar panel costs decline and more people become aware of the financial and environmental benefits of solar energy, solar electricity is becoming increasingly accessible.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Concentrated Solar Power.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Concentrated solar power is even more efficient energy than Solar Panels. A CSP solar farm uses mirrors to reflect and concentrate the sun’s energy towards a tower or other receiver, generating heat that can power a turbine to create electricity.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Solar Heating.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Typical uses of solar space heating systems include powering radiant floors or pairing with a Forced Hot Air (FHA) system to heat a home. Passive solar home design can also heat homes and businesses in the winter considering the placement of windows and the selection of materials used in the building. 
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Solar Transportation.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Solar-powered vehicles may be the future, with existing applications including buses, trains and race cars built by students for events like Solar Car Challenge. There are even Solar Car Races which push the limits of the technology trying to make the cars safer, more compact and more efficient.

					<h3>
						Advantages of using Wind Energy:-
					</h3>
					<dt>
						Cost Effectiveness.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						With a free energy source, land-based wind turbines produce some of the cheapest electricity on the planet. And, because the power produced by wind farms is sold over a long period at a fixed price, there are none of the sudden hikes in price that often affects electricity produced by fossil fuels.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Space Efficient.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Wind turbines are getting both larger and more efficient while maintaining a similar footprint. These bigger turbines do have to be more spread out, but the land between can be used for other things such as food production. Therefore, they may be even more efficient than solar farms!
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Lower Prices.
					<dd>
						As technology improves, so electricity produced by wind production gets cheaper. The last 40 years have seen prices tumble, and while that may not continue at the same rate, the trend is downward for the foreseeable future.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Low Operational Costs.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						In general, once erected and commissioned, wind turbines require little in the way of maintenance. The technology might be sophisticated, but the mechanics are very straightforward and reliable.
					</dd>
				</dl>

					<h3>
						Common Uses/Applications of Wind Energy:-
					</h3>
					<dt>
						Wind Electricity.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Most modern wind power is generated in the form of electricity by converting the rotation of turbine blades into electrical current by means of an electrical generator.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Grain Mills.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						In windmills (a much older technology), wind energy is used to turn mechanical machinery to do physical work, such as crushing grain or pumping water.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Desalinating Water.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Recently, wind energy has also been used to desalinate water. For further information on use of wind power for water desalination, see Wind Energy - Water Desalination.

				<h2>Tidal Energy</h2>
				Tidal energy is produced by the surge of ocean waters during the rise and fall of tides. Tidal energy is a renewable source of energy. During the 20th century, engineers developed ways to use tidal movement to generate electricity in areas where there is a significant tidal range - the difference in area between high tide and low tide. All methods use special generators to convert tidal energy into electricity.

					<h3>
						Advantages of using Tidal Energy:-
					</h3>
					<dt>
						Clean and Compact.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Tidal power is a known green energy source, at least in terms of emitting zero greenhouse gases. It also doesn’t take up that much space.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Tides are predictable.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Unlike the wind and sun, the power of the tide is predictable – so much so, you could practically set your watch by it. We know the cycles that the tides follow, so it’s easy to guess how much energy a tidal power plant will generate in a day!
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Tidal Power Plants last a long time.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The equipment used to capture tidal power is built to last around 4 times longer than wind and solar farms. Concrete tidal barrages can have lifespans of 100 years!
					</dd>
					<dt>
						High Power Genereration.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Water is a dense susbtance, therefore tidal power plants can generate a lot of energy even at low speeds. An underwater turbine can generate energy at 2.2mph, while a wind turbine would need speeds of 7-9mph to start generating power!

					<h3>
						Common Uses/Applications of Tidal Energy:-
					</h3>
					<dt>
						Tidal Electricity.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Like other forms of Energy, the main usage of Tidal Energy is in the generation of Electricity. Tidal Energy is being used in France to generate 240 MW of Tidal Electricity at very low costs.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Grain Mills.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Tidal Energy has been used for hundreds of years. Just like Wind Mills, Tidal Energy was used for the mechanical crushing of grains in grain mills. The movement of Turbines due to Tidal Energy was used in the crush Grains. However, with the advent of Fossil Fuels, this usage of Tidal Energy has become quite low.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Energy Storage.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Tidal Energy can also be used as a store of Energy. Like many of the hydroelectric dams which can be used a large Energy Storage, so Tidal Barrages with their reservoirs can be modified to store energy. Though this has not been tried out, with suitable modifications Tidal Energy can be stored as well though costs may prove to be high.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Protection to Coast during Storms.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Tidal Barrages can prevent Damage to the Coast during High Storms and also provide an easy transport method between the 2 arms of a Bay or an Estuary on which it is built.

						</dd>
						<dt>
							Lower Costs.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							While fossil fuel production requires a heavy outlay of capital, such as oil drills, gas pipelines and fuel collection, biomass technology is much cheaper. Manufacturers and producers are able to generate higher profits from a lower output.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Reduces reliance on fossil fuels.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Not only is there is a limited supply of fossil fuels, but fossil fuels come with environmental baggage, including the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the pollutants that result from removal, transportation and production.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Converts waste into energy.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Biomass production adds a revenue source for manufacturers. Producers of waste can add value by channelling their garbage to create a more profitable use in the form biomass energy. Biomass energy can essentially create energy with things people would've otherwise thrown. Therefore, people can earn secondary income by selling the energy created from waste.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Reduces Garbage.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The amount of garbage dumped in landfills is reduced by 60 to 90 percent, and reduces the cost of landfill disposal and amount of land required for landfill.
