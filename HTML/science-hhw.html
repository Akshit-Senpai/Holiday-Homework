						<h2>China</h2>
						The most important measure in the energy balance of China is the total consumption of 7.14 million GWh of electric energy per year. Renewable energies include wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy sources. This means all energy sources that renew themselves within a short time or are permanently available. China produces around 1.73 million GWh of renewable energy per year, which is around 24% of their total energy consumption.

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				According to me, China is doing the best among all the countries in the world on renewal energy front. China produces the highest amount of renewable energy in the whole world. The other countries which are doing great in this  field are United States of America, Brazil, Canada, India etc. The most efficient source of renewable energy is  Hydro Power, although it takes a lot of investment and time to construct the plant but in the long run, it is very rewarding.
